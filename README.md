# House Price Prediction in California using Regression Techniques
Predicting house prices is a crucial task in real estate, financial planning, and urban development. 
Accurate price estimation helps buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions while 
aiding policymakers in urban planning and resource allocation. This study explores the 
application of machine learning techniques, particularly regression models, to predict median 
house values in California.
The dataset used in this study includes various features that influence housing prices, such as 
median income, total number of rooms, population density, proximity to major cities, and ocean 
access. By analyzing these factors, we aim to identify the key variables that significantly impact 
real estate prices. A Random Forest Regressor is employed as the primary predictive model due 
to its ability to handle complex relationships within the data and mitigate overfitting.
The model undergoes training and evaluation using performance metrics such as Mean Squared 
Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score to assess its predictive accuracy. Results indicate that the 
Random Forest model provides reliable price estimations, highlighting the importance of 
socioeconomic and geographical factors in real estate valuation. Additionally, feature importance 
analysis reveals that median income is the most influential factor in determining house prices, 
followed by location-based attributes.
The findings of this study contribute to the growing field of predictive analytics in real estate by 
demonstrating how machine learning models can enhance decision-making in property valuation. 
The approach adopted in this research can be extended to other regions, providing a scalable 
framework for housing market analysis. Future work may explore advanced deep learning 
techniques and additional socioeconomic indicators to further improve prediction accuracy and 
offer more comprehensive insights into housing price trends.
